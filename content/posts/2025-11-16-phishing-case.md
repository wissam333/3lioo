## Introduction

In this post I'll go through interesting URL submitted I saw on the any run public submission.

## Hunting the source

hxxps://pub-e03b84ede40949d783b7ef41e8b36c50[.]r2[.]dev/web.html#<span style="color: red;">REDACTED</span>@syriatel[.]com.sy

when visiting the URL it looks like an Outlook login page with the prefilled email address <span style="color: red;">REDACTED</span>@syriatel[.]com[.]sy which is written in the URL after the [#] character (I think this email received the spam email that led to the phishing site).
The view source is disabled so I inspect the HTTP request using burp after refreshing the page

<p style="text-align: center;">Outlook phishing page</p> 



![](/assets/images/phishing_case/requsted_js_files.png)
<div align=center>The source of the phishing page</div>

Now we have two js files to analyze 
### First one:

The first script is responsible for creating the html template for the phishing page

<div align="center">The first obfuscated js file</div>

after deobfuscating the file it uses the [unescape](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_unescape.asp) function to generate html page

<div align="center">The generated html page</div>

### Second file

After deobfuscating the second file It appears to be the js file which is responsible for sending the entered credentials to the attacker.

<div align="center">The sending part of code </div>

It sends a post request after using the [atob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob) function to decode the base64 encoded URL. 
The decoded URL is hxxps://gsenddata[.]com/web/dropbox[.]php

The domain is hosting additional files that looks like serving the same purpose.

## Back to start point

Using some google search and parsing any trace for using the same domain that hosts the js files hxxps://eu.starton-ipfs[.]com I found an interesting file hxxps://eu.starton-ipfs[.]com/ipfs//bafybeiffgj723rrq4ejwm7iydforlu2gu4xaog6xhhf2knoyk4ktt53y4y
![](/assets/images/phishing_case/int.png)

by scrolling  to the end of the file we can assume that it writes the em variable to the document

saving this js file and debugging it to extract the string stored in the em variable resulting in a new HTML code

The generated HTML file seems to be an old phishing page, and by viewing its source there is a using of a similar method to the one we saw before, It also stores the base64 encoded URL (in a variable named file) and then sends the entered credentials to the URL after decoding it.

The decoded URL is hxxps://lslamic-relief[.]org/Irworldwide/oba[.]php which is down at the time of writing this post.

### Image of interest

While trying to search for any other clues in the generated HTML file I came across this weird PNG link for the background image 


![](/assets/images/phishing_case/intimg.png)




the image is hosted on hxxps://swatantraindialive7[.]com/wp-includes/  which means it probably compromised by the threat actor


![](/assets/images/phishing_case/imgopen.png)

back to the PNG file and looking through the web it looks like this PNG file is used by a lot of similar phishing pages and seems to be linked to a phish kit, searching for the PNG hash using urlscan.io results thousands of phish sites 

![](/assets/images/phishing_case/imgsearch1.png)

so I decoded the base64 image which has been used in the generated HTML file by the first js file and searched for its hash using urlscan.io and got thousands of phishing sites similar to the one we had (a lot of these sites are hosted by Cloudflare Pages.dev and Workers.dev domains ).
